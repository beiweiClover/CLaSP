# Folder Overview

This Folder contains two main folders related to Uni-Mol model weights:

## Directory Structure

.
 ├── pretrained/
 └── trained/

### 1. `pretrained/`

This folder stores the pre-trained weights for the Uni-Mol model. You can download the model file from the following link:

- [`mol_pre_no_h_220816.pt`](https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol/releases/download/v0.1/mol_pre_no_h_220816.pt)

After downloading, place the file in the `pretrained/` directory.

### 2. `trained/`

This folder stores the trained models from multitask Uni-Mol experiments. It typically contains model checkpoints and training outputs.

The contents of this folder are generated during training and depend on your specific configuration and tasks.

## Notes

Make sure that all required dependencies are installed and the environment is properly set up before using the model weights.
