## Web Service

We provide an online web-based platform for direct access:
**üåê [https://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/CLaSP](https://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/CLaSP)**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice on Access Restrictions
**We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.**  
**Due to the server policy of East China University of Science and Technology (Âçé‰∏úÁêÜÂ∑•Â§ßÂ≠¶), this platform is accessible only between _8:00 AM and 8:00 PM Beijing Time (BJT)_.**  
**Outside of these hours, access is restricted to on-campus users only.**  
_This limitation is enforced by university policy and is not under our direct control. Thank you for your understanding._

## Repository Structure

This repository contains three main folders:

### üìÅ CLVAE
Contains the complete implementation of the CLVAE (Contrastive Learning Variational Autoencoder) model used in the paper.
- Please refer to the README file within this folder for detailed usage instructions

### üìÅ Mutitask_unimol  
Contains the implementation of the multi-task UniMol model used in the paper.
- Please refer to the README file within this folder for detailed usage instructions

### üìÅ ROW_DATA
Contains drug-likeness related datasets used in the paper, including:

#### Pseudo-label Prediction Data
- `ROW_DATA/pseudo-label data/ADMETlab3.0/` - Pseudo-label prediction results based on ADMETlab3.0
- `ROW_DATA/pseudo-label data/admetSAR3.0/` - Pseudo-label prediction results based on admetSAR3.0

These datasets provide important annotation information for model training and evaluation.

## Usage Instructions

Each folder contains detailed README documentation. Please check the specific usage instructions for each module:
- See `CLVAE/README.md` for CLVAE model usage
- See `Mutitask_unimol/README.md` for multi-task UniMol model usage
- See `ROW_DATA/README.md` for detailed dataset information
